When editing this repository, you may wonder why there are no subfolders.
It may be tempting to segment everything into subfolders and deploy it.
However, the server on which this website is deployed has issues with non-flat directory structures,
and so it's probably best to leave it as is.  If you think you can fix it, please do so.
